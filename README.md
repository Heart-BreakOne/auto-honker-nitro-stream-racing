Unfortunately the extension doesn't have a license and no github repo so the entire extension can't be reshared, but nothing prevents you as the user from editing it on your local machine.

You need to make a copy, remove the original extension using the browser extension manager and load your edited extension otherwise Chrome will return a corrupted error.
You can keep your edited extension folder on the Chrome extension folder or elsewhere if you find more convenient, Chrome will be able to load the extension from either.

### Here's where to find the extension folder, you only need the 1.0_0 folder, you be editing the script.js within that folder:

Windows: C:\Users\<Your_User_Name>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User&nbsp;Data\Default\Extensions\plojjdlfbkdogleihmciggfiddccllmb/1.0_0  <br>
<br>
Linux: ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/plojjdlfbkdogleihmciggfiddccllmb/1.0_0 <br>
<br>
Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/plojjdlfbkdogleihmciggfiddccllmb/1.0_0 <br>
<br>
Chromium: ~/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions/plojjdlfbkdogleihmciggfiddccllmb/1.0_0 <br>
<br>

### Keep in mind that your edited extension won't be able to receive official updates, so you have to do that manually, make sure to backup your edits before doing so or they will be lost.
